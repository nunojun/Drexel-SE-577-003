### Objectives
Starting from the prerequisites, CS502 and CS504,
I, as a student who didn't major CS in college, could refresh my knowledge on the basic of CS and SW engineering.
SE575 provided the fundamental of design patterns for me.
In this class, Software Architecture, I hope to extend my insights to the architectural issues.
I personally want to set my career path to the software architecturing and this class would be helpful.

Here are some other comments.
- I am glad to work with **Sean Grimes** again.
You helped me a lot when I took the prerequisites last summer!
- The lecture 1 was impressive to me.
Docker + JVM is what I am working on in my project these days.
I could see it in a different way and it's a good beginning of SW architecture class.
- I like and agree with how the curriculum composes - theory & practical examples.
